# Face Emotion
Recognize face emotion in a picture using the azure face api.

This demo app shows only the first detected face in the picture but the face detection service was build with multiple faces in mind.

See [Azure Face Api](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview) for more information about this service.

## Instructions
create a file called `apis.properties` under the root folder and define a variable called `faceApiKey` with your azure face api key
```groovy
faceApiKey="your_api_key"
```
